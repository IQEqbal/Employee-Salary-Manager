Employee Management System

This is a simple Python program to manage employee wages.

Why do I use a list for employee names?
I store employee names in a list instead of
using a set or dictionary because multiple
employees might have the same name. This way, 
we can handle duplicate names properly.

ğŸ”¸ Search for an employee
ğŸ”¸ Update salaries
ğŸ”¸ Deduct wages based on attendance
